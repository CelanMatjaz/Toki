# Toki

## Project setup

Toki comes with Typescript scripts for downloading Premake and auto generating solutions to make things easier to setup. If you want to run the `generate.bat` in the scripts folder file which does the above automatically for you, then you need to download [Deno](https://deno.land).

You can also run premake from the root directory to achieve the same result.
